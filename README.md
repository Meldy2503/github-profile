A github finder application designed and built by Okafor Emelder for @altSchoolAfrica second semester examination 2022.

This project is a web application built with Reactjs which displays my personal github profile including details of all my repositories.With this application, users can also search and explore various github profiles on https://github.com/.

I utilized various github API endpoints which I consumed using axios, I also utilized frameworks like styled-components for my styling, react-router-dom for the page routing,react-icons for icons and react-helmet-async for SEO optimization.

Below is the link to the project UI:
